#XP005

Here we test several things:
- scipy.sparse.linalg.svds uses an approximation algorithm to compute
SVD on k dimensions with k < dim(M). So we want to test this approximation
in comparison to an exact SVD
- we want to evaluate the impact of min-count on the energy and the number
of dimensions of the final matrix.

## Corpus
We first generate a 1% sample of the English wikipedia enwiki.20190120.txt
```
witokit sample --input /abs/path/to/enwiki.20190120.txt --percent 1 
```
