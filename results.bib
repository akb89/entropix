The proposed model obtains (near) state-of-the art performance for both part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition for a variety of languages. Our model relies only on a few thousand sparse coding-derived features, without applying any modification of the word representations employed for the different tasks. The proposed model has favorable generalization properties as it retains over 89.8% of its average POS tagging accuracy when trained at 1.2% of the total available training data, i.e. 150 sentences per language.},

	abstract = {Word embeddings are increasingly being used as a tool to study word associations in specific corpora. However, it is unclear whether such embeddings reflect enduring properties of language or if they are sensitive to inconsequential variations in the source documents. We find that nearest-neighbor distances are highly sensitive to small changes in the training corpus for a variety of algorithms. For all methods, including specific documents in the training set can result in substantial variations. We show that these effects are more prominent for smaller training corpora. We recommend that users never rely on single embedding models for distance calculations, but rather average over multiple bootstrap samples, especially for small corpora.},

We explore the variation between models trained with only one varying parameter by observing the distributional neighbors variation and show how changing only one parameter can have a massive impact on a given semantic space. We show that the variation is not affecting all words of the semantic space equally. Variation is influenced by parameters such as setting a parameter to its minimum or maximum value but it also depends on the corpus intrinsic features such as the frequency of a word. We identify semantic classes of words remaining stable across the models trained and specific words having high variation.",

abstract="High-dimensional data arise naturally in many domains, and have regularly presented a great challenge for traditional data-mining techniques, both in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Clustering becomes difficult due to the increasing sparsity of such data, as well as the increasing difficulty in distinguishing distances between data points. In this paper we take a novel perspective on the problem of clustering high-dimensional data. Instead of attempting to avoid the curse of dimensionality by observing a lower-dimensional feature subspace, we embrace dimensionality by taking advantage of some inherently high-dimensional phenomena. More specifically, we show that hubness, i.e., the tendency of high-dimensional data to contain points (hubs) that frequently occur in k-nearest neighbor lists of other points, can be successfully exploited in clustering. We validate our hypothesis by proposing several hubness-based clustering algorithms and testing them on high-dimensional data. Experimental results demonstrate good performance of our algorithms in multiple settings, particularly in the presence of large quantities of noise.",

Implications of these findings for theories of categorization are discussed, and it is concluded  that graded structures do not represent invariant structural characteristics of Categories. Instead it is proposed that in stability in graded structure occurs because different concept temporarily represent the same categoy in working memory on different occasions. Rather than being retrieved as: static units from memory to represent categories, concepts originate in a highly flexible process that retrieves generic and episodic information from long-term memory to construct temporary concepts in working memory. Because this concept construction process is highly constrained by goals, context, and jecent experience, the same concept is rarely if ever constructed for a category. A theory of concept construction is presented, and the relations of this theory to dreaming (Foulkes 1985), conceptual combination (Hampton in press a,b; Smith \& Osherson 1984), exemplar theories (Brooks 1978; Jacoby \& Brooks .1984; Media \& Schaeffer 1978), norm theory (Kaimeman \&: Miller, 1986), and parallel distributed processing (McClelland \& Rumelhart 1986; Rumelhart \& McClelland, 1986) are discussed.}},
